# Online Bookstore

## Project Description
This repository is a full-stack online bookshop application offering an intuitive navigation for users to view the product catalog, manage **_CRUD_** operations in the shopping cart, and process online payment through **_PayPal API_**, ensuring secure and reliable transaction environments for users.

## Technical Stack 
The backend of the application is implemented using the framework of **_Python Django_**, with the **_PostgreSQL_** being utilized as the primary database solution for storing the order and user information, **PostgreSQL** comes with more robust features and better performance compared with **SQLite**, the default database embedded into the Django framework.

As for the frontend, I primarily used **_Bootstrap_** for a more modular and easily navigating architecture, **_JavaScript_** and **_AJAX_** were also utilized for ensuring event handling response and asynchronous communication with backend framework.
